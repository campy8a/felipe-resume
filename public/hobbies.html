            <p>
                The Yu-Gi-Oh! trading card game you may know from the tv series. I've been playing it since my school days.<br>
                It involves elements of planning and strategy, also it's entertaining and a tool to get to know more people and how they think/play.

                I've been in contact with videogames of all type since I was young. So I have passion for most of the videogame industry.<br>
                Right now I'm into rougelike games such as Dead Cells or Hades.

            <p>I started practicing boxing a little over 4 years ago. It's great excercise. However, I only practice it as a sport on a sparring level. </p>
